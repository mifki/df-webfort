## Web Fortress ##

Web Fortress is a [DFHack](http://github.com/dfhack/dfhack) plugin that
exposes the rendering and input of a game of
[Dwarf Fortress](http://bay12games.com) over a websocket, and an HTML5
client that allows player to join in a shared game over their browsers.

It is a fork of the [Text Will Be Text](https://github.com/mifki/df-twbt) plugin, by Vitaly Pronkin, and can be used in its place.
